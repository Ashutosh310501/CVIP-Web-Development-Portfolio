        <h3>URL Shortner</h3>
        <p> Developed a URL shortener which is a web-based tool or service that transforms long and complex URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) into shorter, more manageable versions. The primary purpose of a URL shortener is to make links more user-friendly, shareable, and easier to remember. These services are especially useful for sharing links on social media platforms, in printed materials, or in situations where character count matters, such as in text messages or tweets.</p>

        <h3>WebPlayground(Online Code editor)</h3>
        <p>Developed a Online Code editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based tool that allows developers and programmers to write, edit, and execute code directly within their web browsers. These editors are popular among developers because they offer a convenient way to experiment with code, collaborate with others in real-time, and quickly test small code snippets without the need for a dedicated Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or code editor installed on their local machines.</p>
